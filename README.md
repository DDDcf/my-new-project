## PetGuardina AI

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary
PetGuardian AI is an AI platform designed for the comprehensive care of pets. It utilises wearable devices and mobile applications to monitor the health, behaviour, and emotional needs of pets, providing owners with real-time analysis and personalised recommendations.

## Background
Many pet owners struggle to monitor the health and well-being of their animals, which can lead to undetected health issues. This problem is common, as many pets suffer from conditions that could have been treated with early detection.

My motivation stems from a personal experience with my dog, who had a heart murmur. Due to a late diagnosis of his condition, it became complicated, and he passed away. This drives my desire to improve the quality of life for pets and facilitate the responsibilities of their owners.

## How is it used?
PetGuardian AI is primarily used by pet owners who wish for constant monitoring of their animals' well-being. The platform allows users to:
  - Receive alerts about changes in health or behaviour.
  - Consult with veterinarians via telemedicine.
  - Access personalised recommendations for daily care.
The individuals involved in this AI include both pet owners and veterinarians, who can use the information provided by the AI to make informed decisions regarding treatments.


## Data sources and AI methods
PetGuardian AI relies on data collected from wearable devices that monitor physical activity, vital signs, and behavioural patterns. Medical records uploaded by owners will also be used to provide a more comprehensive analysis.

It would also use:
  - Machine learning: To analyse patterns in the collected data and detect anomalies in behaviour that may indicate health issues.
  - Natural language processing (NLP): To interpret the emotional needs of pets through their behaviour and vocalisations.
  - Computer vision: To assess health visually by analysing images uploaded by owners.
  
## Challenges
Although PetGuardian AI offers an innovative solution, it cannot replace professional veterinary care. The platform will not resolve all medical issues nor substitute regular consultations with licensed veterinarians. Additionally, there is a risk that owners may become overly reliant on technology and delay necessary medical attention.

## What next?
The future of the project includes:
  - Expansion into new functionalities, such as a predictive system for diseases based on historical data.
  - Collaborations with veterinary clinics to integrate additional services.
  - Continuous development to enhance analysis accuracy and user experience.
